## PxP Hackathon for Granite Kids Organization

Granite Kids Organization came to us to help solve a problem with gathering donations for the food pantries through out the school district.

We can up with the item of being able to round up online orders to whole dollar and donate the change. They also have the opportunity to make a large donation on the spot. They also can go into the extension and make a one-time or reaccuring donation as they wish. 

## Code Project
The project is a chrome extension. You can load the project into your browser via 'loading an unpacked extension' [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

## Final Goal
To have the extension work where ever a shopping cart is being used. Currently Paypal is the only spot.
